## Installation and Setup

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Zumitify/NLP_Project_Sp25.git
cd NLP_Project_Sp25
```
#### Note you will have to download all files from https://github.com/Zumitify/NLP_Project_Sp25/tree/main/contents manually and replace the one's in 'contents/' directory

2. Navigate to the streamlit directory:
